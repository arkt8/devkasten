# DevKasten

A Zettelkasten like on Development.

It is not linear, not only Markdown or plain text files, but
codes. To read it, pay attention on the file names and directory
structure.

If needed you may find also Markdown files, and sometimes
Makefiles also. Anyway the code should be very commented.
